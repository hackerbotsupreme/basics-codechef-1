#lesson 1


#the main thing i from here is when i write a  name of the list then if i put in into the loop twith i (traversal loop)
#then the i will go from the starrting to end elelment 
# one important previous lesson leart is computer identifies i when we put it on the correct/right synax 
#or it will peint error and show you that i is not defined , loop adds context to i .(mathematical problems-3.txt, trials )     



#cls --- is the common to clear the terminal history



#approach2--kick-out method 
# i want analyze the the inpts (with conditions )and 
# then upon verification  i will add them to a list then i will measure the length of the list.





















#approach 3 --using if - else - nest loop 
#i want ot use if-else- nested loop to analyze the inputs and then count them or add them in the list and measure 
#and print that as an output
