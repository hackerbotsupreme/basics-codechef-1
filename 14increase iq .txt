problem statement 
a study has shown that a musical instrument helps in inceasing iq by 7 poinnts .
chef knows he cant beat einstein in physics ,but he wants  to try to beat him in an iq competitioon .

you know that einstein that einstein had an iq of 170 and chef has an iq of X.
determine if , after laearnuing to play a musical instruments, chefs iq will become
strictly greater than einsteins .

print"yes"  if it is possible for chef to beat einstein , else print "no" (withhout quotes )
you may print each charecter of the string in either uppercase or lowercase (for example , the strings yes )


input format 
1. the first  and only line of input  will contain a single integer X , the current iq of chef .


output format 
1. for each testcase , output in a single line "yes" or "no"
2. you may print each charecter of the string of the string either uppercase 


constraints 
100≤X≤169


subtasks 

subtask #1 (100 points ) : original constraints 
sample 1 :
 input 
 165
 output 
 yes 

input120
output 
no


Explanations :
 after learning a musical instrument , chef's  final iq  will be 120+7=127 <170 . chef cannot  beat einstain .
