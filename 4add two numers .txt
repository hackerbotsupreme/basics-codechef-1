problem statement 
the task is very simple : given two integers  A and B , write a program to add these two numbers  to add these two numbers and output  it.


INPUT FORMAT
the first line containes an integer T, the total nnumber of teest cases . then follie  T lines , each line contains two integers A and B .


OUTPUT FORMAT
fOR EACH CASE , ADD a AND b AND DISPLAY THE SUM IN A NEW LINE .
Everything your program prints is considered “output”, so if you output some debugging statements like “Please enter T”, this will be considered as part of your answer, and because it does not satisfy the output format, it will be marked wrong, even if your answer is otherwise correct!
